# 1. Two Sum
# Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
# You can return the answer in any order.
# This solution has a time complexity of O(NÂ²) where N = nums.Length.
# This solution has a space complexity of O(1).
